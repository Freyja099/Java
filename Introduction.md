# Why Java?
- TOP 3 most popular languages
- Extremely flexible
- If we write a source code and run it on a mac we can only run that code on a mac and the same concept applies for pcs, but with java we can solve this problem.

With Java we have an intermediary step where we can compile our source code to a format callled **byte code**, it's a cross platform and ends with a dot class file extension ( .class ). To translate the byte code to machine code we use JVM ( java virtual machine ) which is included in the JDK.
# What is JDK

JDK : Java Development Kit, it contains developers tools to help us code as well as a JRE which is a Java Runtime Environment which contains libraries and toolkits and JVM which translate the byte code into machine code

The main method is like a magical spell or incantation that we have to say in order to get the program to run 
Inside : public class Main { }
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">public static void main(String[] args){}</mark>
